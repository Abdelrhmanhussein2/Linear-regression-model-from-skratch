# 📊 Student Performance - Linear Regression from Scratch

This project demonstrates how to build a Multiple Linear Regression model from scratch using Python and NumPy. The dataset contains academic performance data of students, with the goal of predicting their final scores based on various lifestyle and academic-related input features.

## 🧠 Objective

To understand and implement the full pipeline of a regression model, including:

- 🧹 Data preprocessing  
- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- 🔍 Feature selection  
- 🧮 Model implementation using NumPy (no libraries like sklearn for modeling)  
- 📈 Model evaluation using R² score

## 📁 Dataset

- Source: [Student Performance Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshitshankhdhar/student-performance-prediction)
- Format: CSV file
- Key Features:
  - Hours Studied
  - Previous Scores
  - Sleep Hours
  - Extracurricular Activities
  - Final Score (target)

## 🛠 Libraries Used

The following libraries are used for data handling, visualization, and evaluation only:

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score
